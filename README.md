# Toric-Arrangements
This project is a record for my Math REU program in 2019 Summer.

REU (Research Experience for Undergraduate) is a program funded by NSF (National Science 
Foundation).
Here is a link to this program: https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/

I did this project during 2019 Summer with joint work of Yue (Amanda) Yao, 
under the mentoring of Dr. Christin Bibby, a combinatorial topologist,
supported by the Mathematics department in the University of Michigan.

This depository is a record of the SageMath (a python-based mathematical tool) code we 
wrote to construct the posets and polynomials associating with a toric arrangement and
the paper we wrote as a final report of REU.

Files:
The Faces of Toric Arrangements.pdf is the paper for this project
Toric_Arrangement_Polynomials.sage is the program we wrote for this project.

The paper will be post in the website of math department later.
